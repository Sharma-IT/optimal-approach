            <h2>Original Manifesto</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>This "Optimal" approach isn't about rigidly adhering to pre-built frameworks designed for other scenarios. Instead, it champions being inherently context-driven, risk-based and iterative, but importantly, it's also guided by a core set of fundamental principles (e.g., customer-centricity, security, scalability, maintainability, etc). It leverages the invaluable resource of your (and your team's) intuition, experience, and data, but this intuition is grounded in disciplined experimentation and rigorous validation. We draw upon the "best" aspects from various external approaches, selectively integrating what's relevant to our specific needs, all while maintaining simplicity and minimalism. Crucially, we operate with clearly defined goals and metrics to guide our efforts and measure success. This includes actively and proactively identifying potential risks and developing mitigation strategies. This approach thrives on fostering explicit collaboration and valuing diverse perspectives within the team. It empowers individuals and teams to take ownership, fostering a sense of responsibility. We then continuously iterate improvements after initial use based on robust analytics and comprehensive feedback, making sure to consider the broader ecosystem and the impact on all stakeholders including customers. Furthermore, we ensure effective communication and transparency throughout the process. Finally, this "Optimal" approach itself is not static; we regularly review and adapt the method itself based on new experiences and evolving contexts, always keeping ethical considerations in mind.</p>
